Objects: In Salesforce objects are use to store data. In the object we can create multple fields. One object can conatins
multiple records.

Object in salesforce is similar to Sql tables. 

There are 2 types of objects available in salesforce.

    1. Standard Objects(Pree defined)
    2. User defined objects

    Example: lets say we have Student object.
            Student contains several fileds like Name, age, rollNo, class etc.
            collection of all thsese filds toghter known as record.

    
    Note: With every object salesforce create API name filed which prefix by _ at the end. API filed name is same as the custome lable name.
